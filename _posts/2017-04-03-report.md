# What Go Wrong

Our original goal was first to build and train a model that could detect details, or what we call tags, from the images, and then create another model that could take the tags and return captions of the pictures. We read some papers and checked some models designed by others. However, we find there are some problems with the models that could convert images to tags. 

One problem was the unrelated tags. When we tried to use a pre-trained model called `Inception V4` to convert the images, the model returned some tags that were not related to the captions. For example, for the following picture, the model returned `Labrador retriever`, `golden retriever`, `Chesapeake Bay retriever`, `Rhodesian ridgeback`, `American Staffordshire terrier`, `Staffordshire terrier`, `American pit bull terrier` etc. It seems that the model was more interested in detecting the dog breeds instead of what the dog was doing.

Another problem was the training time and resources. When we followed an instruction from TensorFlow Slim Image Classification Model, we downloaded a 13 GB original datasets and spent another 70 GB to store the formatted datasets. When the training begins, it supposes to finish in 7 days. Since we were training the model on a paid GPU machine, we could not offer such long training time.

As a result, we decided to use the pre-trained model and begin to build the second model. We will talk more about this in `Next Steps`.

Before we decided to give up building the first model, we had generated images to tags for `Flickr8K`. You can click [here]() to see the dataset we generated.
