### Project Title: Image Captioning

### Project Idea

We want to train the machine to detect details from an image (such as dog and toy) and then output a sentence to describe the image.

For example, for the following image, the model should detect a brown dog and a blue and yellow toy. And it can output a sentence like "A dog is trying to catch a blue and yellow toy."
