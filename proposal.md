### Project Title

Image Captioning

### Project Idea

We want to train the machine to detect details from an image (such as ) and then output a sentence to describe the image.

For example, for the following image, the model should detect a brown dog and a blue toy. And it can output a sentence like "A dog is trying to catch a blue and toy."
